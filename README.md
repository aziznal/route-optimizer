# What is this?

A simple program with a pygame-based GUI that allows the user to pick points on a map that they choose, and connect those points to create paths between them.

# Why is this?

Two Reasons:

1. I wanted to get into path finding algorithms, and to understand how graphs, nodes, and arcs worked.


2. Because I like to run experiments on areas around me, such my city. What is the best route to take to get from home to college the quickest? Are the results of my implementation the same as known apps such as Google Maps? Why or why not? etc. Having an easy(ish) way of doing that is why I wrote the GUI part of this program.

# Why `pygame`?

I didn't think of any other libraries at the time, and I really just wanted to get into the real action as quickly as I could. pygame has given no problems yet!

# What algorithms did I use? What problems does this solve?

The main issue that this program aims to solve is the infamous ***Traveling Salesman Problem***. I have not decided on any algorithms / heuristics yet.
